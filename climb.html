<h1>Bouldering the Bay Area</h1>
<p>After New Years 2018, I started thinking about how I wanted my life to be at the end of 2018. One of these goals was to be climbing harder and climbing outdoors. At this point I had been climbing steadily for about a year, all at indoor climbing gyms. I realized that if someone were to ask my why I only climb indoors, my answer would have heavily relied upon always having fresh routes available to try. This is a benefit of climbing gyms, but not an excuse I can use as I have not climbed any of the outdoor routes in my area. I decided that I was going to set an intentionally loose goal. I would strive to climb every route within a reasonable distance from the Bay Area. My first day bouldering outdoors, I realized that climbing topos weren't very user friendly and information is sometimes scarce and incomplete. I decided that alongside my goal of climbing all the routes in the bay area, I would also create some modernized topos that can give someone unfamiliar with the area clear information about locations, routes, and beta.</p>
